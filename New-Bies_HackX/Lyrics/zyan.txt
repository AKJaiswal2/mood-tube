Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?

'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise
On your sins just me and you

[Zayn and Sia:]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try

Baby, I am right here

But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here

[Video version addition:]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

[Video interlude:]
[Cop:]
Your life in the daytime is over. There's eyes on you everywhere. You know that, right? I'm watching you. My crew's watching you. You know your little homies? They pissed off. They mad at you, bro. Your name is mud on the streets. Oh, I know who you are.
[Zayn:]
You don't know me.

We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We would roll down the rapids
To find a wave that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?

[Zayn and Sia:]
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise
On your sins just me and you

Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try

Baby, I am right here

But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here

[Video version addition:]
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here

Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl, give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it

Girl give love to your body
It's only you that can stop it
Girl give love to your body
Girl give love to your body

But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
